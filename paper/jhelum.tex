Tidally disrupted globular clusters produce long, thin and dynamically cold stellar streams that preserve a historical record of any gravitational perturbations.
Signatures of perturbation appear as low surface brightness features and have historically been hard to detect due to contamination from field stars.
We use astrometric data from the Gaia second data release and photometry from the Dark Energy Survey to identify highly probable members of Jhelum, a retrograde stellar stream in the Milky Way halo.
The decontaminated map of Jhelum reveals that the stream has two components: a thin component and an offset, diffuse component.
The width and the significance of the diffuse component vary along the stream, however, the two components have the same ratio of blue straggler to blue horizontal branch stars.
This suggests that the debris originates from a single progenitor, and that the complex morphology has been imparted by its dynamical evolution in a changing environment.
Further modeling of Jhelum, as well as similar studies of other streams, should .

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

% - mw provides opportunity to study processes of gal formation in archaelogical evidence
% - halo dynamical times, streams track that change
% 
% - streams regular so far
% - dynamical environment, should have features
% - now with gaia can study those

Stars escaping from globular clusters form thin, dynamically cold tidal streams \citep[e.g.,][]{combes1999}.
The phase-space distribution of tidal debris is predominantly determined by the gravitational tidal field, so \citet{johnston1999} proposed measuring the distribution of matter in the Galaxy using stellar streams.
In detail, the mean track of a stream constrains the enclosed mass at its current location \citep{bh2018}.
As more than 40 stellar streams have been discovered at a range of distances in the Milky Way halo \citep[see][for a recent review]{gc2016}, streams should provide a three-dimensional map of the Galaxy.

Being long and thin structures, stellar streams also preserve a historical record of gravitational perturbations on small scales and have been discussed as tracers of dark matter substructure \citep[e.g.,][]{johnston2002, carlberg2009}.
A telltale signature of an interaction with a dark matter subhalo is a gap in the stellar density along the stream \citep[e.g.,][]{yoon2011, eb2015}.
Tantalizing hints of stream gaps were first observed in the early photometric surveys \citep[e.g.,][]{carlberg2012,cg2013}, and gaps were definitively detected in the GD-1 stellar stream \citep{gd2006} when \citet{pwb} used \gaia\ proper motions to cleanly select likely stream members.
This discovery opened a new era in which globular cluster streams are no longer simple tracers of the global gravitational potential, but instead provide additional constraints  through their complex density structure.

In addition to opening gaps along the stream, a dynamic, clumpy and/or time-dependent, environment can disperse stars from originally thin streams to form much wider structures \citep[e.g.,][]{bonaca2014, ngan2016, pw2016, pearson2017}.
Alternatively, a globular cluster that started disrupting in a satellite galaxy before its accretion to the main Milky Way halo, creates a cold stream that is also accompanied by a wide, low surface-brightness component (Carlberg, in preparation).
Wide extensions have not yet been detected around the known cold streams, however, recent improvements in identifying stream members motivate a more comprehensive search.

Here we present the first evidence for two components of the Jhelum stream.
Discovered as a photometric overdensity in the Dark Energy Survey \citep[DES,][]{abbott2018}, Jhelum is a $\sim30^\circ$ long and $\sim1^\circ$ wide stellar stream at a distance of $\sim13\,$kpc \citep{shipp2018}.
Like GD-1, Jhelum is also on a retrograde orbit with respect to the Milky Way disk \citep{malhan2018}, so we use \gaia\ proper motions in addition to DES photometry to better select likely members (\S\ref{sec:data}).
The resulting map of the stream reveals that Jhelum has a thin and a wide component; we compare and contrast these components in \S\ref{sec:structure}.
In \S\ref{sec:discussion} we conclude with a discussion of possible origin scenarios.

% - streams expected to trace the gravitational potential
% - cold streams optimal because simple structures, easy to model
% 
% - cold streams so far indeed looked regular
% - very similar N-body models of disrupting globular clusters in simple potentials
% - however, in more realistic (live, nbody) potential they are often disturbed
% 
% - from photometric data alone, tenative signs of disturbance are present in the closest stream -- GD-1
% - these were made certain with Gaia selection -- evidence not only of gaps, but also of extra stream material
% - suggests that further scrutiny of Galactic streams is warranted, as they might not be as simple as previously thought


\section{Data}
\label{sec:data}
We start our analysis by defining a coordinate system $(\phi_1,\phi_2)$ that is aligned with the Jhelum stellar stream.
The great circle best-fitting the Jhelum track has a pole $(\alpha_{2000},\delta_{2000}) = (359.1^\circ, 38.2^\circ)$ \citep{shipp2018}.
The rotation matrix\footnote{Also available electronically at \url{https://github.com/abonaca/jhelum}.} that converts equatorial $(\alpha, \delta)$ coordinates to Jhelum coordinates $(\phi_1, \phi_2)$, where $\phi_1$ is the coordinate along the stream and $\phi_2$ is perpendicular to the stream track, is provided in the Appendix.
In these coordinates, Jhelum is centered at $\phi_2=0$, and the DES detection spans $-5^\circ\lesssim\phi_1\lesssim25^\circ$ \citep{shipp2018}.

\includegraphics[width=0.95\columnwidth]{selection.pdf}

\caption{
(Top) Proper motions of photometry-selected stars along the Jhelum stream (left) and in a control field (right). 
(Bottom) Similarly, color-magnitude diagrams of stars selected on proper motions.
Photometric and proper-motion selection boxes are shown in light orange.
Jhelum stands out from the Milky Way field population in proper motions as a retrograde stream, and in the color-magnitude diagram where its main sequence is more metal-poor than the field, and is accompanied by blue stragglers (medium orange) and blue horizontal branch stars (dark orange box).
}
\label{fig:properties}
\end{figure}

We query the Gaia DR2 \citep{gdr2} and DES DR1 \citep{abbott2018} catalogs between $-10^\circ<\phi_1<35^\circ$ and $-5^\circ<\phi_2<5^\circ$, and select all sources identified as stars that are brighter than $g_0<23$, while excluding stars with parallaxes larger than $1\,\rm mas$.
DES photometry was dereddened using \citet{sfd} dust maps.
Assuming a constant distance along the stream of 13\,kpc, we correct the whole catalog for the solar reflex motion following \citet{pwb}.

Following these corrections, Jhelum stars becomes readily distinct from the Milky Way field population.
Figure~\ref{fig:properties} shows proper motions (top) and color-magnitude diagram (bottom) for a stream field ($0^\circ<\phi_1<25^\circ$, $0^\circ<\phi_2<1^\circ$, left) and a comparison field ($0^\circ<\phi_1<25^\circ$, $3.5^\circ<|\phi_2|<4^\circ$, right).
In proper motions, Jhelum stands out from the Milky Way as a retrograde stream, and we select likely members between $-8<\mu_{\phi_1,\star}/{\rm mas\,yr^{-1}}<-4$ and $-2<\mu_{\phi_2}/{\rm mas\,yr^{-1}}<2$.
The stream also appears as a prominent overdensity of main sequence stars, which we select following a 12\,Gyr old, metal-poor ($\rm[Fe/H]=-1.5$) MIST isochrone \citep{choi2016} between $19<g_0<21.3$.
Both of these selection regions are shown in light orange in Figure~\ref{fig:properties}.
In the next section, we discuss the spatial distribution of identified Jhelum member stars.


\section{Density structure of Jhelum}
\label{sec:structure}

\begin{figure*}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{map.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{
(Top left) Sky positions of likely Jhelum members in the stream coordinate system reveal for the first time a complex morphology in a cold stream.
Member selection is based on the \gaia\ proper motions and DES photometry, and excludes nearby contaminants using \gaia\ parallaxes.
(Top right) Profile of likely Jhelum members between $-5^\circ<\phi_1<25^\circ$ is asymmetric, with a narrow, dense component at $\phi_2>0^\circ$ and a more diffuse, wide component at $\phi_2<0^\circ$.
This morphology is intrinsic to the stellar stream, as similar signatures are absent from the full stellar density field (middle) and the dust map (bottom).
}
\label{fig:map}
\end{figure*}

Sky positions of Jhelum members selected in Section~\ref{sec:data} are presented in the top left panel of Figure~\ref{fig:map}. 
Although some contamination from the Milky Way field stars remains, the stream stands out as an overdensity between $-5^\circ<\phi_1<25^\circ$, $-1^\circ<\phi_2<1^\circ$.
Despite the increase in the purity of the stream membership, this extent is similar to the initial detection reported by \citet{shipp2018}.
However, the new data reveal unexpected internal structure of the stream: the density of stream members is higher at $\phi_2>0$ than at $\phi_2<0$.
The $\phi_2$ distribution of likely Jhelum members (Figure~\ref{fig:map}, top right) appears bimodal, with a more prominent, narrow component at $\phi_2>0$, and a less prominent, diffuse component peaking at $\phi_2\approx0$.

Surveys such as Gaia and DES have complex selection functions \citep[e.g.,][]{bovy2017}, which can imprint density inhomogeneities in all stellar maps.
To test whether the density structure observed in Jhelum is inherited from a survey strategy, we show a density map of all stars in our input catalog (Gaia crossmatched with DES, and with parallax $\varpi<1\,\rm mas$) in the middle panel of Figure~\ref{fig:map}.
Dashed white lines bracket the two Jhelum components.
The lines are offset from the best-fitting polynomial to the running median of the dense Jhelum component: \input{polytrack}.
Whereas there is a large density gradient along the $\phi_1$ direction, as positive $\phi_1$ values correspond to lower galactic latitudes, the overall stellar density changes little across the stream in the $\phi_2$ direction at a fixed $\phi_1$ location.

Density variations observed in streams can also originate from nonuniform dust attenuation \citep[e.g.,][]{ibata2016}.
In that case, the features observed in the stream correlate with a dust map.
Extinction along Jhelum varies between $A_V\sim0.2-0.5$ \citep[Figure~\ref{fig:map}, bottom;][]{sfd}.
The regions of high dust attenuation at $(\phi_1,\phi_2)\approx(1^\circ,0.5^\circ)$ and $(\phi_1,\phi_2)\approx(19^\circ,-2^\circ)$ correspond to regions of reduced Jhelum density, however, there are no global gradients in dust extinction perpendicular to the stream.
Therefore, the transverse variations in Jhelum density are intrinsic to the stream itself.

\begin{figure*}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{phi2_histograms.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{
The profile of likely Jhelum members changes along the stream.
Panels show $5^\circ$ wide regions along the stream, with the location in $\phi_1$ (indicated at the top) growing from left to right.
Between $-3^\circ<\phi_1<2^\circ$, only a narrow component of the stream is present, while in the next $\phi_1$ bin, $6^\circ<\phi_1<11^\circ$, the stream features both the narrow and the wide component.
Further along the stream, $15^\circ<\phi_1<20^\circ$, the stream consists of two narrow components separated by a gap, while at the trailing end, $20^\circ<\phi_1<25^\circ$, the gap vanishes and the stream appears as a single, wide feature.
}
\label{fig:histo}
\end{figure*}

To quantify substructure in the Jhelum stellar stream, we model the $\phi_2$ distribution of likely stream members (Figure~\ref{fig:map}, top right).
We assume a mixture model with two Gaussian components (defined by means $\mu_{1,2}$ and variances $\sigma^2_{1,2}$ for the narrow and wide component, respectively) and a background which is allowed to linearly vary with $\phi_2$ (defined by the gradient $a\rm_{bg}$).
The density model for a given set of parameters $\theta = (\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_{\rm bg}, \mu_1, \mu_2, \sigma_1, \sigma_2, a_{\rm bg})$ is:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
p(\phi_2 | \theta) = &\alpha_1 \mathcal{N}(\phi_2 | \mu_1, \sigma_1) + \alpha_2 \mathcal{N}(\phi_2 | \mu_2, \sigma_2) \\
&+\alpha_{\rm bg} (a_{\rm bg}\phi_2 + \mathcal{U}(-5,5))
\label{eq:model}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $\alpha_{1,2}$ are the fractions of stars in the narrow and wide components, respectively, and $\alpha_{\rm bg} = 1 - \alpha_1 - \alpha_2$ is the fraction of the Milky Way field stars.
We sample the parameter space $\theta$ with an affine invariant Markov Chain Monte Carlo ensemble sampler \citep{emcee}.
The sampler ran with 64 walkers for 4096 steps, the first half of which were discarded as the burn-in, assuming flat priors in normalizations and means, and log-uniform priors for the variances and the background gradient.
The highest-likelihood model (gray line in the top right of Figure~\ref{fig:map}) reproduces well the observed distribution of Jhelum stars.
The amplitudes of both Gaussian components are statistically significant: \input{a1} for the narrow, and \input{a2} for the diffuse component.
Their respective widths are \input{s1}\,deg and \input{s2}\,deg.
At a distance of 13\,kpc, this corresponds to \input{w1}\,pc and \input{w2}\,pc, respectively, which is comparable to the widths of globular cluster streams in the Milky Way.

The transverse structure of the Jhelum stream is globally asymmetric, however, there are variations along the stream (see Figure~\ref{fig:map}).
In Figure~\ref{fig:histo} we show the transverse density profiles in four non-overlapping regions.
Splitting the original sample increases the influence of Poisson statistics in the profiles, so we only discuss their features qualitatively.
The left-most panel shows that leading end of the stream ($-3^\circ<\phi_1<2^\circ$) consists of a single, narrow component.
Two components are detected both between $6^\circ<\phi_1<11^\circ$ and between $15^\circ<\phi_1<20^\circ$, however, while the component at smaller $\phi_2$ is wide in the former region (second panel from left), it is narrow in the latter and clearly separated from the narrow component at larger $\phi_2$ (third panel).
At Jhelum's trailing end ($20^\circ<\phi_1<25^\circ$, right-most panel), there is again a single component, but almost twice as wide as that on the leading end.
Curiously, the narrow component visible in the first three panels has an approximately constant width.
This diversity of transverse density profiles along Jhelum underlines the intricacy of its formation history.
In the next section we discuss scenarios which could produce such structures.

\section{The origin of Jhelum components}
\label{sec:origin}
The Jhelum stellar stream appears to have two spatially distinct components (Figure~\ref{fig:map}).
If these components originate from the same progenitor, their stellar populations should be similar and their kinematic profiles should provide insights into dynamical processes that formed them.
Otherwise, we would expect the components to differ both in stellar population and kinematics.
To uncover Jhelum's origin, we first compare stellar populations and kinematics in its components, and then explore orbital solutions that fit the stream.

A number of blue horizontal branch (BHB) and blue straggler (BS) stars are present in Jhelum, with a low contamination rate from field stars (bottom panels of Figure~\ref{fig:properties}).
The ratio of BHB to BS stars can distinguish between massive dwarf galaxy and globular cluster progenitors \citep[e.g.,][]{deason2015}, so we characterize the Jhelum stellar population with the BS to BHB ratio.
We select BHBs at the Jhelum distance with: $-0.7<g-i<-0.2$, $15.5<g<16.5$ (dark orange box in Figure~\ref{fig:properties}) and BSs within the polygon $(g-i,g) = [(0.2,18.9), (0.2, 19.9), (-0.25, 18.7), (-0.25,17.7)]$ (medium orange box).
In the Jhelum footprint (both spatial and proper-motion) there are a total of 31 BSs and 12 BHBs, compared to 7 BS and 3 BHB stars in the control field.
This yields an intrinsic BS to BHB ratio of $N_{BS} / N_{BHB} = 2.7\pm 1.0$, consistent with a $M_V\approx-8$ dwarf galaxy progenitor.
Split between the two components, the ratio becomes $2.1\pm1.2$ and $3.3\pm1.9$ for the narrow and wide component, respectively.
Within uncertainties, the BHB to BS ratio is the same in the two Jhelum components, indicating a common origin.
However, detailed chemical abundances from spectroscopy are required to definitively confirm the single-progenitor scenario.

% - if indeed a single progenitor, could be that just projected 2 component, but in fact a sheet whose one side is observed edge-on in a fold 
% - if such a shell, would expect the denser part to be at the apocenter
% - to test this, we need distances
% - parallaxes bad, but bhb standard candles, no difference, no gradient
% - assuming distance constant and 13\,kpc, the likely members in cylindrical coordinates on figure
% - denser part at the inner z edge -- not a conventional shell / fold

- to understand better the environment that shaped it, we find a best fitting orbit to the narrow track, bhb for distances, proper motions
- assuming a simple multi-component MW potential
- best-fitting orbit is regular, chaos not important on relevant time scales (lyapunov time)
- inner halo -- not lmc, but might be influenced by the bar
- this is not very likely as the stream is retrograde, but merits further investigation


\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}
- summary
- same progenitor, truly 2 components, not reproducible in a simple static model

- listing of possible other explanations:
\begin{itemize}
 \item multiple progenitors (e.g., gc + dwarf galaxy) -- however, stellar populations uniform across the stream, but could further test with chemical abundances
 \item dynamically cold structure in the progenitor -- contrived?
 \item caustic -- would happen preferentially at the apocenter, but stream is just past the pericenter, so this type ruled out, however, it could be also a caustic of a fully phase-mixed distribution
 \item chaos -- would need to be close to a resonant orbit, but orbit looks regular (although chaotic orbit might still be possible if the adopted potential is very different from the true one)
 \item precession of orbital plane if close to the disk on approx circular orbit (Dehnen2018), or if pericenter is close to the center of the Galaxy (eccentric orbit at some angle wrt the disk; Erkal2016) -- eccentricity = 0.5, zmax = 30 kpc; -- not captured in the streakline model
%  \item lmc effect? -- not that close in the past
%  \item a bar effect? -- seems like crossed the plane at very small x, y ($R\sim7\,\rm kpc$), will create a stream model in a barred potential
\end{itemize}

- multiple wraps -- globular clusters disrupting in a cosmological N-body dark matter halo produce cold streams that are accompanied by a diffuse, dynamically older component (R.~Carlberg, private communication), penarrubia

- spectroscopy will help -- test single progenitor through chemical abundances
- can distinguish between different scenarios based on mean radial velocity trends and also velocity dispersion

- rich in information
